# bundle-properties-util

This is created to automate creating "bundle.properties" for mindustry json mods

This utility uses external library "hjson" so install it too if you don't have

`pip install hjson`

To use just run main.py and it will ask you to put mod directory. Put it, example:

put json mod directory: `C://Users/user/desktop/mods/mod`

and hit enter, then if all is correct it will run thru all files and return:

Successful created C:\Users\user\desktop\mods\mod\bundles\bundle_new.properties

then find new bundle and rename it.
